# HousingDataCleaning

With most metropolitan cities going through their own housing crisis, I thought it would be interesting to look into publicly available housing data in Nashville, Tennesse. In this project I cleaned housing data in PostgreSQL. I worked on standardizing data types, breaking addresses down into individual columns for ease of analysis, removed duplicates and deleted unused columns.

Included: excel sheet for cleaning, SQL Scripts
